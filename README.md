Initial readme.
This project aims to implement 3D rotations using quarternions (as opposed to Euler rotations) written in object orientated C++.

It is thought of as an educational project exploring quarternions, OOP, C++, version control, and collaborative programming. The main program is to be written in C++, but Python might be used to facilitate plots and tests.

Literature references can be found in the .lit folder.

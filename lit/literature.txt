This file contains references to the literature used throughout the project.
It will include references that are directly used, e.g. the Wikipedia page on quarternions, as well as background references, e.g. C++ tutorials.
Notation will be the reference followed followed by a short description. They will be sepperated by a dash (-).
References are sorted by subject.

Quarternions:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion - Heavy mathematical focus. Good as background.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation - The rotational mathematics to be implemented.
https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Quaternion.html - Short, yet usefull, introduction to quarternions.
http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Quaternions - Example of quarternion implementation in code (C++ and Python).

C:
The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie (K&R) - Must read reference on C!
